		<h2>Front End</h2>
		<p>🌐 I'm a React and Next.js addict!</p>
		<p>🧩 React, with its component-based architecture, has truly transformed the way I think about building user interfaces. It's like having a box of versatile Lego bricks – each piece can be used to construct something unique and beautiful. The simplicity and flexibility React offers have made it an indispensable tool in my developer toolkit.</p>

		<p>🍒 Then there's Next.js – the cherry on top of React! </p>	 
			<p>Next.js has been a game-changer for server-side rendering, static site generation, and building lightning-fast web applications. It's amazing how it seamlessly integrates with React, making the development process smoother and more efficient.</p>
			<p>🌍  What truly excites me about these technologies is not just their technical capabilities but how they align with Green IT principles. Efficient code means less resource usage and a smaller carbon footprint, which is a big win for our planet!

		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>🎻 I began my musical journey at the age of 7 at the Conservatoire d'Avignon. I continued my studies at the Conservatoire de Lyon, where I unanimously won the Viola Prize, as well as prizes in chamber music and solfège. During my advanced studies at the Conservatoire de Rueil-Malmaison, I was admitted to the Haute École de Musique de Genève for a Bachelor's degree, studying under Zoltàn Toth and later Ori Kam.

			Under the guidance of these masters, I developed a passion for chamber music and contemporary music.</p><p>
			
			✈️ Later, I joined the class of soloist Tatjana Masurenko for a Master's degree in Leipzig, Germany. During this time, I won a competition to become a Substitute in the Staatskapelle Halle orchestra.</p>
			
			<p>🎼 As a versatile artist, I then balanced my life between performing as a soloist, chamber musician, orchestral player and electronic music musician and composer.</p>
